# GuardRails
VSCode extension to help developers set up guardrails around their functions, by helping them disambiguate purpose statements. 

- The VSCode extension is available on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MrigankPawagi.guardrails).
- A dataset on the performance of GuardRails in comparison with Copilot Chat is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRwmXlP8V6gbXtB1oQ5IUXfbRjW3eoCYKcbm-zN4uXphd_AK4Wj0CZzVmeXW4XvF2_scszdCD89CFpV/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).
